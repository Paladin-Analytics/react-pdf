          began talking again. “DinahPll miss me very much to-night, I should th
          ink!” (Dinah was the cat.) “I hope theyPll remember her saucer of mi

          hatPs very like a mouse, you know. ‘ut do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And
          here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, i
          n a dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and some
          times, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldnPt answer either qu
          estion, it didnPt much matter which way she put it. She felt that she
          was do6ing oZ, and had Fust begun to dream that she was walking ha
          nd in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dina
          h, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly, thump! t
          hump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over
          Alice was not a bit hurt, and she Fumped up on to her feet in a
          moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was
          another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying
          down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the
          wind, and was Fust in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my
          ears and whiskers, how late itPs getting!” She was close behind it when
          she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she
          found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps
          hanging from the roof.
          There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and
          when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other,
          trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how
          she was ever to get out again.
          Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it eCcept a tiny golden key, and AlicePs xrst th
